Made with create-react-app

Out of habit I use npm to install packages.

```yarn start``` to run

What I'm trying to do is use the apollo-client in didMount, or rather without the Query component. The goal is to send a mutation there and not be tied to the jsx, like the wrapped React component.

I'm just trying to make a request and log the result. 

Actually before I finshed writing this readme, I solved the problem.
